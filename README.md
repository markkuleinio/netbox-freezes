# netbox-freezes

The purpose of this repository is to save the "pip freeze" outputs for basic
NetBox installation when new NetBox versions are released.

This may help someone later in the future if an old NetBox version is to be installed
for any reason: these are the package versions that were used when a particular NetBox
version was originally released.
